Simple DirectX 11 pet renderer heavily based on DX11 SDK tutorials.

# Things done

 - Windowed rendering
 - Light types: point, directional, ambient (background)
 - Lights defined physical quantities/units
 - Blinn-Phong material model
 - Simple, but physically based bloom post-processing effect (so far just for single-sampled rendering)
